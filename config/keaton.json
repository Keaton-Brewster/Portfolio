    "bio": "Born and Raised in Topeka, KS, I made my escape to Kansas City in 2019 and haven't looked back (except for all the times I go to see family and old friends...) I started coding in the summer of 2020, and fell in love. I attended KU's coding bootcamp in the fall of 2020 to accelerate my learning, and get into the industry quicker, as I couldn't wait to code professionally. I live in south Kansas City with my wife in our newly purchased home, and in my free time I enjoy exploring new music.",
